Simple nfo to html/utf8 converter.

I say nfo but basically code page 437 encoding.

Eventually I want to make this a readme parser for [GitHub](https://github.com/github/markup). Need to figure that out first I guess.

## CLI Usage ##
This is crummy because it's really simple!!

    ./cli.rb whatever.nfo

    ./cli.rb -h whatever.nfo > whatever.html
    google-chrome whatever.html
